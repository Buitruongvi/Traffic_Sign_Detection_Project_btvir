# Traffic Sign Detection Project

Traffic Sign Detection is an application that involves using algorithms related to Object Detection to detect traffic signs on the road. 
Traffic Sign Detection models are commonly used in various applications such as self-driving cars, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and more. 
A typical Traffic Sign Detection program consists of two stages: locating the position of the traffic sign and recognizing the name or content of the sign. 
Therefore, a high-precision program needs to excel in both of these components.

In this project, we will build a Traffic Sign Detection program using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The input and output of the program are as follows:
- Input: An image containing traffic signs. This image can be provided in various image file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or any other image format.
- Output: The program will provide information about the coordinates and names (classes) of all the traffic signs present in the image.
